# Step 2 Prompt

Let's work on step2

Start with creating a branch "step2". Remember to do that also when we work on the next steps in the future

For step2, I want the code skeleton of the state machine logic.
You don't have to implement now the logic for each step, I am only interested about the interface or method definition, as well as the core loop
There's is a .env file available that you can use to load api keys.

Make the code readable. I prefer ease of maintenance over efficiency
