# Step 1 Prompt

I want to build a program that acts as an automous agent for the game spacetraders.io.

Documentation: https://spacetraders.io/
Open API spec: https://spacetraders.io/openapi

The first step of this project is you describe in a file AgentLogic.md the logic for a simple agent that continuously negotiate contracts and fulfill them.
I do not want to see code yet. I want to see a description in english of a state machine. Include the calls that need to be made to the spacetraders.io api

Oh and before doing anything, create new git branch!
